# About This Project

**Em** is a thought experiment, personal project, and evolving framework for human-centered artificial intelligence.

This blog documents the exploration of:

- Ethical AI design
- Emotional context in assistants
- Memory-driven interaction models
- Tools for thinking, not replacing thought

> Em is not a product. She’s a personal companion AI designed and built in my own time, with my own resources, to explore what comes next for digital interfaces that serve people — not platforms.

**All work on Em is done outside of any professional affiliation. The views expressed here are solely my own.**
